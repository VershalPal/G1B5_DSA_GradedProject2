# Skyscraper Construction and BST Modification

This repository contains Java programs for two different problems:

1. **Skyscraper Construction**
2. **BST Modification**

## Skyscraper Construction

### Problem Description
The program analyzes the construction process of a skyscraper in Mumbai. The construction involves assembling floors from different factories based on size constraints. Each day, a floor of a distinct size is constructed in a separate factory. The program determines the order in which floors can be assembled, ensuring that the larger floor sizes are placed at the bottom and the smaller sizes at the top.

### How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. Input the total number of floors in the building.
3. Input the size of the floor given by factories on each day.
4. The program will output the order in which floors can be assembled.

## BST Modification

### Problem Description
The program modifies a Binary Search Tree (BST) used for managing transactions in an MNC. The new requirement specifies that the BST should not contain any left nodes. To meet this requirement, the program converts the BST into a skewed tree and displays the node values in ascending order.

### How to Use
1. Run the program.
2. The BST is hard-coded in the program.
3. The program will modify the BST and display the node values in ascending order.

### IDE used :
- Eclipse IDE
